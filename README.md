# A Dockerized Basic Auth Wrapper for any React App.

This is a work in progress for learning purposes and not meant to be used publicly unless you know what you are doing. Basic Authentication is not in any way a safe and secure way to protect private stuff, it requires your credentials to be sent on every request and you to keep them safe.
It can merely (barely) act as a way to keep the general public from viewing something.
